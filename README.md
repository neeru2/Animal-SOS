### Project Description
Develop a web application, "Animal SOS," to streamline animal rescue, treatment, and adoption. The platform will allow admins to manage rescue requests, advertise healthy animals for adoption, and enable users to filter pets by type and location, view details, and sign up for adoption with ease.

### The Problem statement
Stray and injured animals often lack timely rescue, treatment, and structured adoption processes. Potential adopters face challenges in finding suitable pets due to unorganized platforms and limited information.
