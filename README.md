### Project Description
The Animal Rescue and Adoption Web App is a digital platform designed to facilitate 
animal welfare by enabling users to report rescue needs, allowing administrators to
manage rescue requests, and connecting rescued animals with potential adopters.
Through an intuitive interface, the application tracks each animal's journey from
initial rescue to treatment and final adoption, providing a streamlined, transparent
process that empowers community members to actively participate in animal rescue efforts.



### The Problem statement
Many stray and injured animals lack a systematic approach for rescue, treatment, and
finding permanent homes. Existing methods often involve fragmented communication, lack
of centralized tracking, and inefficient processes for animal welfare.

### The Solution
The Animal Rescue and Adoption Web App solves the fragmented animal welfare challenge
by providing a comprehensive digital platform that enables users to report rescue needs, 
allows administrators to manage and track animal status, and connects rescued animals
with potential adopters.
